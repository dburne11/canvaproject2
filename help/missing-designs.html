                        <h2>Missing designs</h2>
                        <p>Been working on a design and now can't find it? Here are some possible reasons why this might happen and how to find them.</p>
                        
                        <h3>You may have more than one Doodloo account</h3>
                        <p>If you've logged into Canva and you can't find your designs, you might've logged into the wrong account.</p>
                        <p>If you can't remember your login details for your other accounts, you can reset your password from the login page.</p>

                        <h3>You've deleted your design</h3>
                        <p>Deleting designs directly from Projects also deletes them from the folders they're in. You can recover deleted designs by going to Trash.</p>
                        <p>Note that all deleted designs in Trash will be permanently deleted after 30 days. If you've deleted a design and more than 30 days have passed, it can't be recovered.</p>
